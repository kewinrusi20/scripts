# Floats & Pending Float

In LaTeX, "floats" refer to elements like figures and tables that are not part of the regular text flow. Instead of appearing exactly where they are defined in the LaTeX source code, they "float" to a location that LaTeX thinks is best based on the typesetting rules, which include avoiding bad page breaks, keeping the float near its in-text reference, and maintaining overall aesthetics.

A "pending float" is a float that has been processed by LaTeX but hasn't yet been placed onto a page. When LaTeX compiles a document, it gathers floats and decides where to place them based on the rules for float placement and the specifiers provided by the author (like `h` for "here", `t` for "top", `b` for "bottom", and `p` for "on a separate float page"). If LaTeX can't find an appropriate place that satisfies these conditions, the float remains pending.

Pending floats can accumulate if LaTeX is unable to position them satisfactorily, often because there's not enough room left on the page, or because the constraints imposed by the document designer are too strict.

Commands like `\clearpage` and `\cleardoublepage` are used to handle pending floats. When called, `\clearpage` will cause all pending floats to be flushed outâ€”that is, LaTeX will place all of them into the document before starting a new page, regardless of its usual placement rules. This ensures that no floats are left hanging and that they all appear before any new content that follows.
