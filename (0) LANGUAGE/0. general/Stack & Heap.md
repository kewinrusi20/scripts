When a new object is created in Java, the memory is allocated in two different areas: the **Heap** and the **Stack**.

**Heap**:

- The actual **object** itself is stored in the heap.
- This includes the **values of the instance variables**.

**Stack**:

- Each time an object is declared, a new **reference** is created in the stack.
- This reference points to the location in the heap where the actual object is stored.
- If the object is created inside a method, the reference is removed when the method execution is completed.

So, in summary, the objectâ€™s actual data (instance variables) are stored in the heap, while the reference to the object is stored in the stack. This allows for efficient memory management and garbage collection.
