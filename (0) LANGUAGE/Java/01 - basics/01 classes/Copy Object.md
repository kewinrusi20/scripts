In Java, to copy an object, you generally have two options:

1. **Shallow Copy**: This creates a new object but does not duplicate the contained objects. In other words, it copies the object's fields, but not the referenced objects. This means changes made to the original object's contained objects will reflect in the copied object and vice versa.

1. **Deep Copy**: This creates a new object and also duplicates the contained objects. It recursively copies all referenced objects, so changes made to the original object's contained objects won't affect the copied object, and vice versa.
