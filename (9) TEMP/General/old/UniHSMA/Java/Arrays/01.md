## Add New Elements to the Array
Concept:
1. You have to create a Draft Array, that it's +1 bigger, of the Main one, 
bacause you want to add a new Value in it.
2. Copy all the content of the Main one in the Draft,
3. Asign the new value, to the draft one
4. at the end, recopy the content of the Draft Array, to the Main one

Example: 
1. ```java
List_FLASH = new String[List_MAIN.length + 1];

2. ```java
for (int j = 0; j < PlayerList_MAIN.length; j++){  
    PlayerList_FLASH[j] = PlayerList_MAIN[j];  
}

3. ```java
PlayerList_FLASH[i] = inputName;


4. ```java 
PlayerList_MAIN = PlayerList_FLASH;
